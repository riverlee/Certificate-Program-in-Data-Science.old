# Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table

## Goal

We will use Python/Tensorflow to do ML analysis

- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Looking at features which will include
    - What is the missing value for each of the feature
    - What is the correlations between each feature
- Transform the data: Given EDA result, transform the feature data to make it work for the ML Pipeline
- ML Analysis: use the feature to predict whether a **Pump**is functional or not


## Challenge Summary
![](http://drivendata.materials.s3.amazonaws.com/pumps/pumping.jpg)

**Can you predict which water pumps are faulty?**

Using data from [Taarifa](http://taarifa.org/) and the [Tanzanian Ministry of Water](http://maji.go.tz/), can you predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all? This is an intermediate-level practice competition. Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

## The features in this dataset

Your goal is to predict the operating condition of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset. You are provided the following set of information about the waterpoints:

- **amount_tsh** - Total static head (amount water available to waterpoint)
- **date_recorded** - The date the row was entered
- **funder** - Who funded the well
- **gps_height** - Altitude of the well
- **installer** - Organization that installed the well
- **longitude** - GPS coordinate
- **latitude** - GPS coordinate
- **wpt_name** - Name of the waterpoint if there is one
- **num_private** -
- **basin** - Geographic water basin
- **subvillage** - Geographic location
- **region** - Geographic location
- **region_code** - Geographic location (coded)
- **district_code** - Geographic location (coded)
- **lga** - Geographic location
- **ward** - Geographic location
- **population** - Population around the well
- **public_meeting** - True/False
- **recorded_by** - Group entering this row of data
- **scheme_management** - Who operates the waterpoint
- **scheme_name** - Who operates the waterpoint
- **permit** - If the waterpoint is permitted
- **construction_year** - Year the waterpoint was constructed
- **extraction_type** - The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses
- **extraction_type_group** - The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses
- **extraction_type_class** - The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses
- **management** - How the waterpoint is managed
- **management_group** - How the waterpoint is managed
- **payment** - What the water costs
- **payment_type** - What the water costs
- **water_quality** - The quality of the water
- **quality_group** - The quality of the water
- **quantity** - The quantity of water
- **quantity_group** - The quantity of water
- **source** - The source of the water
- **source_type** - The source of the water
- **source_class** - The source of the water
- **waterpoint_type** - The kind of waterpoint
- **waterpoint_type_group** - The kind of waterpoint

## The labels in this dataset

![](http://drivendata.materials.s3.amazonaws.com/pumps/labeldistribution.png)

### Distribution of Labels
The labels in this dataset are simple. There are three possible values:

- **functional** - the waterpoint is operational and there are no repairs needed
- **functional needs repair** - the waterpoint is operational, but needs repairs
- **non functional** - the waterpoint is not operational


## Submission format

The format for the submission file is simply the row id and the predicted label (for an example, see **[SubmissionFormat.csv](data/SubmissionFormat.csv)** on the data download page.

Your .csv file that you submit would look like:

```
id,status_group
50785,functional
51630,functional
17168,functional
45559,functional
...
```
